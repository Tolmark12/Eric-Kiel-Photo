√ change ©Eric Kiel 2009 to 2010

√ change under photos to “see FILM REEL from this shoot”

+ You can change this... stock categories should be “PEOPLE PLACES MOTION”

√ (modified) when on stock site logo should read “Eric Kiel stock photography” and stock should be white like photography

√ (modified) when on stock site get rid of portfolio/reel etc and have it read “Facts & Pricing   Ask a Question    Contact”

• Indicate w/ more clarity which section you're in

• search box and font need to be bigger- maybe move to side or bottom to make top less cluttered?

• ALL font on site should match main font

• ONLY tag words used should show up

• when search has no results we need to tell the user, not do nothing as it does now

• can we easily go back to home page? And to stock home page?

√ top should read: Portfolio   Stock   Film Reel   Campaign   Contact

• Add image number# to bottom of enlarged photos

√ Watch film from this shoot...

• stock site should be kielphotostock.com
